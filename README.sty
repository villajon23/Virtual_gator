Read me file for ShootingPose_classification
Code can be found in 
    mediapipe website:   https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/holistic
                         https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose

    and also in github which we used and made changes to this code to work for what we wanted
                         https://github.com/nicknochnack/Body-Language-Decoder  




Download dependicies (We used conda install)
1. python(latest versions)
2. mediapipe 
3. opencv
4. pandas
5. scikit-learn
6. if you get numpy errors then updgrade it


Run Detection model from mediapipe to start detection
    
    run and then exit out of cell this is just to start variables 
    continue to next cells

Capture landmarks and output into a csv
    
    First create a class name you want the pose to have
    with live video feed record your pose or action you want to get coordiantes for
    append to csv
    Do this for every class name(new pose or ation)


Classification model trained using Scikit Learn library
    
    Random forest works best

Train Classification model with machine learning


Evaluate model


Apply it to the pose detection model 
    
    will run your trained classification model on the detection model


To read in a csv file thats already trained just run all the code without running folliwing sections

    2.1
    2.2
    2.3 
    In section 3.1 change the file mane you want to reading
